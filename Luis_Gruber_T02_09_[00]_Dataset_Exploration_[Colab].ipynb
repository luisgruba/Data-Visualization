The number of flights coming out of a smaller airport should be viewed differently compared to a very large international airport that sees hundreds of flights daily, however, this dataset views them equally. This skews our data by weighing the flights the same, despite there being a different value. Smaller airports also have a greater chance of being in a location with more weather that would delay a flight. A second issue with having this bias is that the data does not contain more information about longer flights (flights anywhere that are not to the contiguous United States, such as international flights or flights to AK and HI). (International) flights typically use larger aircrafts which can cause a different sort of delay in taxing due to having a larger passenger count, longer refueling and thus a larger preparation time and turnover rate.\n",

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) considers a flight to be delayed when it is 15 minutes later than its scheduled time. However, our data shows that our smallest delay time is 6 minutes. With this information, we can confirm that there may be some automation bias involved. (Automation bias is a tendency to favor results generated by automated systems over those generated by non-automated systems, irrespective of the error rates of each.) If employees are favoring results generated by automated systems, then it is possible that those systems and models in place could be inaccurate because they are not checking the accuracy of the model. This could lead to some bias towards specific airlines if they are leaving less than 15 minutes later than expected but having that small delay count as a flight delay by the U.S. Department of Transportation's (DOT)."

Filling these gaps would make our dataset less biased as we would have a more specified look into why a flight could be delayed and whether or not the cause is due to humans, weather, or something different. This data is also coming from 2008, yet there is another source from the BTS taken from a more recent year, 2015. These new reports are released every month, meaning the most updated version should be available often. The final change we could make to mitigate bias is to gain a better understanding of the airlines since there are many parent companies with smaller companies underneath them. This would help our analysis by helping us understand if there is a difference in delays between airlines."

One way to reduce bias is by modifying the columns and including the average traffic passing through each airport. A second way to mitigate the bias in our model is to join in a dataset about weather patterns. Places this dataset could be obtained is through NOAA, any weather-related news source, or a GitHub/Kaggle.

A secondary rule that should be also be put in place for people or systems is to review the data annually.
